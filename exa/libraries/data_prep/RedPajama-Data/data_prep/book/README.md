### Books

Follow these instructions to create the Books dataset.

We use the following two datasets: the pg19 subset of Gutenberg and the-pile-books3 for Books3, both downloaded from
Huggingface.

To download the dataset, run the following commands.

```bash
mkdir -p data/book/
python ./book/download.py
```

The data in JSON format should be around 119GB after downloading. Using the script `dedup.py`, we remove duplicates
when combining those two datasets. For deduplication, SIMHASH is used to map each book to a hash value and to remove
books within a certain distance. Run the following command to install the SIMHASH library.

```
pip install simhash
```

As a default setting, we compute `w = 6` grams of the entire book text with `l = 0` and find duplications with the
hyperparameter `k = 5`. We run the deduplication process on `n = 100` processors. To change the settings, you can
change the hyperparameters `-w`, `-k`, `-l`, and `-n`.

```bash
mkdir -p data/book/split/
split -a 3 -d -l 2000 ./data/book/books3-train.jsonl ./data/book/split/books3_
split -a 3 -d -l 2000 ./data/book/pg19-train.jsonl ./data/book/split/pg19_
cat ./data/book/pg19-test.jsonl > ./data/book/split/pg19_014
cat ./data/book/pg19-validation.jsonl >> ./data/book/split/pg19_014
python ./book/dedup.py -w W -k K -l L -n N
```

After downloading the dataset, run the following command to count tokens. (Assuming you are in `data_prep`)

```bash
rm ./data/book/books3-train.jsonl
rm ./data/book/pg19-*
python ./book/token_count.py
```
